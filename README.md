## üîñ  Overview

This is a minimal Next.js application based on the  [Quick Start Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) in the Next documentation.

Use this app to help you get started and not have to do all the boring settings and focus on what matters to code  üòç

## Getting Started

How to run the project

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/)) .
Besides, it's nice to have an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### üß≠ Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ npx create-next-app [project-name] --example https://github.com/NatanaelBorges/next-quick-start.git

# Access the project folder on your terminal/cmd
$ cd [project-name]

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run start

# The application will open at the door:3000 - access http://localhost:3000

```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.

## Reminder

Don't forget to change the ***project name*** in üëâ [package.json](https://github.com/NatanaelBorges/next-quick-start/blob/main/package.json) to *your project name*.

## Technologies

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

#### **Frontend**  ([React](https://reactjs.org/)  +  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)**
- **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)**
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**
- **[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)**
- **[Jest.js](https://jestjs.io/)**

> See the file  [package.json](https://github.com/NatanaelBorges/next-quick-start/blob/main/package.json)

## Development Stream

Before starting to develop update the libs, as it may be that there is a newer version.

I like to use this command [npm outdated](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-outdated) and update lib by lib, so I can know if any lib has undergone any major changes

**Main Commands**

|Command|What it does|
|--|--|
|npm run dev| execute the project |
|npm test| execute the tests  |
|npm run storybook  | execute the storybook |
