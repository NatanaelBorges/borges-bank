## üîñ  About this Project

The idea of the app is:

_‚ÄúSharing knowledge in the form of a digital bank, providing a simple way to learn‚Äù._

PS: Borges Bank was just the context chosen by me for this project, but all code inside this app can be reused for any app, so you can reuse everything here in your next project!

Project developed with a focus on learning. All its content is fictitious.

## Some Observations about this App

1 - There's no functionality of Login/Register, the buttons and the forms in the Login Screen are only for UI matters.

2 - The only option that works is the links, which will be redirected to their respective screens, all the others are for UI issues only.

## Development Stream

Before starting to develop update the libs, as it may be that there is a newer version.

I like to use this command [npm outdated](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-outdated) and update lib by lib, so I can know if any lib has undergone any major changes

**Main Commands**

|Command|What it does|
|--|--|
|npm run dev| execute the project |
|npm test| execute the tests  |
|npm run storybook  | execute the storybook |
